# GameJamStarterKit
A library to help jump start game jams with some universal code and menus that most Game Jam games will use.

Known issues:
	When getting from source control, if there are new audio assets, the Audio Database clears itself and needs to be rebuild.  Use the Menu Tools->Fix Audio Clips to fix it.
